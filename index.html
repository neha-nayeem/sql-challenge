  <h1>Assignment: sql-challenge</h1>
  <section>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.</p>
    <p>In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Data Engineering/Data Modeling</li>
      <li>Data Analysis</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All files are inside the folder named for the challenge `EmployeeSQL`. This folder contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A `data` folder that contains the six CSV files.</li>
      <li>An `images` folder that contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram, and visualizations from the bonus analysis.</li>
      <li>An `employee_db_schema.sql` file that contains the table schema for the six tables.</li>
      <li>An `employee_db_queries.sql` file that contains the eight queries created to answer the questions under *Data Analysis* below.</li>
      <li>A Jupyter notebook called `bonus-analysis.ipynb` to further analyze the SQL database and create visualizations.</li>
    </ul>
